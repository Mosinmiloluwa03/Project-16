        <h1>Light</h1>
        <p>Light, visible light, or visible radiation is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human
            eye. Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of
            400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent
            to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter
            wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively optical radiation.</p>

                    <strong>This section defines and explains light in physics terms.</strong> In physics, the term
                    "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or
                    not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary
                    properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and
                    polarization. Its speed in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.
                    Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary
                    particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as
                    both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in
                    modern physics. <code>.accordion-body</code>

                    <strong>This section enlightens more on Electromagnetic spectrum.</strong> Generally,
                    electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is classified by wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared,
                    the visible spectrum that we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The designation
                    "radiation" excludes static electric, magnetic and near fields.

                    The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower
                    frequencies have longer wavelengths. When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its
                    behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.

                    EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that are at the lower end of the
                    energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes
                    in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR
                    becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy
                    to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the
                    human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision. <code>.accordion-body</code>

                    <strong>This section wraps up by stating and explaining all the sources of light .</strong>There are many sources of light. A body at
                    a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source
                    is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around 6,000 K (5,730 °C;
                    10,340 °F). Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted
                    in wavelength units,[20] and roughly 44% of the radiation that reaches the ground is visible.[21]
                    Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible
                    light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid
                    particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction
                    in the visible spectrum. The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another
                    important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps.
                    With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively
                    replaced firelight. <code>.accordion-body</code>
